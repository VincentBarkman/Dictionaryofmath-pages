# Absolute Value

The absolute value of a real number is its numerical value without regard to its sign. In other words, absolute value converts negative numbers to positive numbers, while leaving positive numbers and zero unchanged.

## Definition

The absolute value of a real number `a` is denoted by `|a|`. It is defined as follows:
```python
|a| = a, if a ≥ 0
|a| = -a, if a < 0
```
Thus, for any real number `a`, the absolute value `|a|` is always non-negative.

## Properties

Here are some important properties of absolute values:

1. **Non-negativity**: For any real number `a, |a| ≥ 0`.
2. **Definite Positivity**: For any non-zero real number `a, |a| > 0`.
3. **Symmetry**: For any real number `a, |-a| = |a|`.
4. **Triangle Inequality**: For any real numbers `a and b`, `|a + b| ≤ |a| + |b|`.
5. **Preservation of Zero**: `|0| = 0`.

## Applications

Absolute value is a fundamental concept in mathematics with wide-ranging applications. It is used in various fields of study including algebra, calculus, geometry, and trigonometry. In real-world terms, absolute value is often used when negative values of a variable are either not possible or should not count as less than zero, such as in calculations involving distances, lengths, or magnitudes.
