# Mathematical Symbols

Mathematical symbols are used to perform various operations. The use of these symbols in the expression makes it easier to understand and simplify the expression. Here are some of the most commonly used symbols:

## Basic Operations

- `+` : Addition. Example: 3 + 2 equals 5.
- `-` : Subtraction. Example: 5 - 2 equals 3.
- `*` or `×` : Multiplication. Example: 3 * 2 equals 6.
- `/` or `÷` : Division. Example: 6 / 2 equals 3.
- `^` or `**`: Exponentiation. Example: 2^3 equals 8.

## Equality and Inequality

- `=` : Equals. Example: 2 + 2 = 4.
- `!=` or `≠` : Not equal to. Example: 2 ≠ 3.
- `<` : Less than. Example: 2 < 3.
- `>` : Greater than. Example: 3 > 2.
- `<=` or `≤` : Less than or equal to. Example: 2 ≤ 2.
- `>=` or `≥` : Greater than or equal to. Example: 3 ≥ 3.

## Sets

- `{}` : Set notation. Example: {1, 2, 3} is a set that includes 1, 2, and 3.
- `∈` : Element of a set. Example: 1 ∈ {1, 2, 3} means 1 is in the set.
- `∉` : Not an element of a set. Example: 4 ∉ {1, 2, 3} means 4 is not in the set.
- `∪` : Union of sets. Example: {1, 2} ∪ {2, 3} equals {1, 2, 3}.
- `∩` : Intersection of sets. Example: {1, 2} ∩ {2, 3} equals {2}.

## Others

- `∞` : Infinity. It represents an unbounded quantity.
- `∆` : Delta. It often represents a change in a quantity.
- `π` : Pi. It is approximately 3.14159 and represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.
- `e` : Euler's number. It is approximately 2.71828 and is the base of the natural logarithm.
- `i` : Imaginary unit. It is defined as the square root of -1.
