# Natural Numbers

The **natural numbers**, commonly denoted as **ℕ**, form the backbone of the entire number system and much of abstract algebra.

## Definition

The natural numbers start at `1` and continue indefinitely in the positive direction:
```python
ℕ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}
```
The definition of natural numbers is closely linked to the Peano axioms, a set of axioms for the natural numbers proposed by Giuseppe Peano. 

## Peano Axioms

1. There is a natural number `1`.
2. Every natural number has a unique successor, which is also a natural number.
3. There is no natural number whose successor is `1`.
4. Distinct natural numbers have distinct successors.
5. If a property belongs to `1`, and if the implication `(K(n)` implies `K(n+1))` holds for every natural number `n`, then the property belongs to every natural number.

## Properties of Natural Numbers

Natural numbers have several important properties:

1. **Closure Property**: If you add or multiply two natural numbers, the result is always a natural number.

2. **Associative Property**: For all natural numbers `a, b, and c, (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) and (a * b) * c = a * (b * c)`.

3. **Commutative Property**: For all natural numbers `a and b, a + b = b + a and a * b = b * a`.

4. **Distributive Property**: For all natural numbers `a, b, and c, a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c`.

5. **Identity Property**: The number 1 is the multiplicative identity in the set of natural numbers. There is no additive identity in the set of natural numbers.

6. **No Negatives**: There is no natural number that, when added to another natural number, results in `0`.

## Well-Ordering Principle

The well-ordering principle is a fundamental property of the natural numbers. It states that any non-empty set of natural numbers has a least element. This principle is the foundation of many proofs in number theory.

## Note

Zero is not traditionally considered a natural number, but some mathematicians include it, depending on the context. For the purpose of this explanation, we've defined natural numbers as starting from `1`.
