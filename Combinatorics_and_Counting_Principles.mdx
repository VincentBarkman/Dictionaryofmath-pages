# Combinatorics and Counting Principles

Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics that studies counting, both as a means and an end in obtaining results, and certain properties of finite structures. 

## Basic Principles of Counting

There are two fundamental principles of counting:

1. **The Addition Principle**: If there are `n` ways to do one thing and `m` ways to do another, and these two things cannot be done at the same time, then there are `n + m` ways to choose one of the actions.

2. **The Multiplication Principle**: If there are `n` ways to do one thing and `m` ways to do another, then there are `n * m` ways to do both.

## Permutations and Combinations

In combinatorics, we're often interested in the number of ways to arrange or choose objects.

1. **Permutations**: A permutation of a set is, loosely speaking, an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order. For example, the permutations of {1,2,3} are {1,2,3}, {1,3,2}, {2,1,3}, {2,3,1}, {3,1,2}, {3,2,1}. 

2. **Combinations**: A combination is a selection of items without considering the order. For example, the combinations of {1,2,3} taken `2` at a time are {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}. 

## Binomial Coefficients

The binomial coefficients appear as the numbers of ways to choose `k` items from `n` items without regard to the order of selection. 

Binomial coefficients can be calculated using the formula: 
```python
(n choose k) = n! / [k!(n - k)!]
```
where `n!` denotes the factorial of `n`, which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

Combinatorics has many applications in computer science, physics, statistics, and other fields.
