# Differentiation Rules

In calculus, differentiation rules are formulas that allow us to find the derivative of a function easily. They are based on the definition of the derivative and simplify the process of differentiation.

## Constant Rule

The derivative of a constant function is zero. If `f(x) = c`, where `c` is a constant, then `f'(x) = 0`.

## Power Rule

The power rule is used when differentiating functions of the form `f(x) = x^n`, where `n` is any real number. The power rule states that `f'(x) = n * x^(n-1)`.

## Product Rule

The product rule is used when differentiating the product of two functions. If `f(x) = g(x) * h(x)`, then the derivative of `f` is `f'(x) = g'(x) * h(x) + g(x) * h'(x)`.

## Quotient Rule

The quotient rule is used when differentiating the quotient of two functions. If `f(x) = g(x) / h(x)`, then the derivative of `f` is `f'(x) = [g'(x) * h(x) - g(x) * h'(x)] / [h(x)]Â²`.

## Chain Rule

The chain rule is used when differentiating the composition of two functions. If `f(x) = g(h(x))`, then the derivative of `f` is `f'(x) = g'(h(x)) * h'(x)`.

## Trigonometric Functions

The derivatives of the sine and cosine functions are: `(sin(x))' = cos(x)` and `(cos(x))' = -sin(x)`. For the other trigonometric functions, their derivatives can be derived using the quotient rule.

## Exponential and Logarithm Functions

The derivative of the natural exponential function is `(e^x)' = e^x`. The derivative of the natural logarithm function is `(ln(x))' = 1/x`. For other exponential and logarithm functions, their derivatives can be calculated using the chain rule.

These rules form the basis for differentiating a wide variety of functions. By combining these rules, it's possible to compute the derivatives of complex functions efficiently.
