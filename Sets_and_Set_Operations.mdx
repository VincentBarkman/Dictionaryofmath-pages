# Sets and Set Operations

In mathematics, a set is a collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. Sets are one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics.

## Definition of a Set

A set is a collection of objects, called the elements or members of the set. A set is defined by specifying the properties that its members must satisfy, or by listing its members between curly braces.

For example, a set of natural numbers less than 10 can be written as:
```python
S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
```
## Basic Set Operations

1. **Union of sets `(A ∪ B)`**: The union of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both.

2. **Intersection of sets `(A ∩ B)`**: The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in both A and B.

3. **Difference of sets `(A - B)`**: The difference of the set B from the set A (also known as the set-theoretic difference of `A and B`), is the set of elements that are in `A` but not in `B`.

4. **Complement of a set `(A)`**: The complement of a set A refers to elements not in A.

5. **Cartesian product `(A x B)`**: The Cartesian product of A and B is the set of all ordered pairs `(a, b)` where a is in `A and b` is in `B`.

These operations can be used to manipulate sets in various ways, and they form the basis for a branch of mathematics known as set theory.
