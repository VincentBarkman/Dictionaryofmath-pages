# Subtraction

Subtraction is one of the four basic operations in arithmetic, along with addition, multiplication, and division. It's essentially the opposite of addition. The process of subtraction involves taking away one number from another, which results in the difference.

## Definition

Subtraction involves two numbers: the minuend, from which another number (subtrahend) is taken, to result in the difference. For example, in the equation `5 - 3 = 2`, `5` is the minuend, `3` is the subtrahend, and `2` is the difference.

## Properties of Subtraction

Subtraction has several important properties:

1. **Non-Commutative**: Unlike addition and multiplication, subtraction is not commutative. If `a and b` are any real numbers, then in general, `a - b ≠ b - a`.

2. **Non-Associative**: Subtraction is not associative. If `a, b, and c` are any real numbers, then in general, `(a - b) - c ≠ a - (b - c)`.

3. **Identity Property**: If you subtract `0` from any number, the difference is that number. If a is any real number, then `a - 0 = a`.

4. **Inverse Property**: The difference between a number and itself is zero. If a is any real number, then `a - a = 0`.

## Applications

Subtraction is a fundamental concept in arithmetic and algebra. It's used in a wide variety of applications, from simple everyday calculations such as counting change or understanding debts, to more complex mathematical scenarios in science, engineering, economics, and beyond. Understanding subtraction is crucial for more advanced mathematical concepts and real-world problem-solving.
