# Expressions and Equations

Expressions and equations are fundamental concepts in algebra that represent numerical relationships.

## Expressions

An expression is a combination of numbers, variables, and operations. Examples of expressions include `2x, 3y + 7`, and `5x^2 - 3x + 2`. 

Expressions do not have an equals sign `=` and do not represent a specific value; rather, they represent a type of computation. The value of an expression can change depending on the values of its variables.

## Equations

An equation is a statement that two expressions are equal. It contains an equals sign `=`. Examples of equations include `2x = 6, 3y + 7 = 10`, and `5x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0`.

Equations represent a balance between two expressions. Solving an equation often involves finding the values of the variables that make the equation true.

## Applications

Expressions and equations are used extensively in mathematics and related fields, such as physics, engineering, computer science, and economics. They form the basis for solving problems, modeling relationships, and understanding data.
