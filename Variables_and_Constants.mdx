# Variables and Constants

Variables and constants are two fundamental concepts in algebra, which are used to represent numbers and perform operations. 

## Variables

A variable is a symbol, often a letter, that stands for an unknown or changing value. For example, in the equation `y = 2x + 1`, `x` and `y` are variables. The value of `y` changes depending on the value of `x`. 

Variables can represent any number and are often used in equations, functions, and formulas to solve for unknown quantities. They are a key element in algebra and calculus.

## Constants

A constant, on the other hand, is a value that does not change. In the equation `y = 2x + 1`, `2` and `1` are constants because their values are fixed.

Constants can be numbers like `2 or 1`, but they can also be symbols that represent fixed numbers. For example, in mathematics, the symbol `Ï€` is a constant that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately `3.14159`.

## Applications

Variables and constants are used extensively in mathematics, science, engineering, and economics to model and solve problems. Understanding these concepts is essential to developing mathematical literacy and problem-solving skills.
