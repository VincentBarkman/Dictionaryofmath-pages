# Unit Circle

The unit circle is a fundamental concept in mathematics, particularly in trigonometry and complex number theory. It is a circle with a radius of 1 and its center at the origin of the coordinate plane `(0,0)`.

## Definition

The unit circle is defined by the equation `x² + y² = 1`. Any point `(x, y)` that satisfies this equation lies on the unit circle.

## Trigonometry and the Unit Circle

The unit circle is closely related to trigonometry. The x-coordinate of a point on the unit circle corresponds to the cosine of the angle formed by the positive x-axis and the line segment from the origin to the point, while the y-coordinate corresponds to the sine of this angle.

This relationship is often written as:
```python
cos(θ) = x
```
```python
sin(θ) = y
```
where `θ (theta)` is the angle in radians.

## Complex Numbers and the Unit Circle

In the complex plane, the unit circle can also be described using complex numbers. Every point on the unit circle corresponds to a complex number of the form `e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)`, where i is the imaginary unit.

## Applications

The unit circle is a fundamental tool in many areas of mathematics, including trigonometry, calculus, geometry, and complex analysis. It's also used in physics and engineering to study periodic phenomena, waveforms, and rotations.
