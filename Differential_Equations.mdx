# Differential Equations

A differential equation is an equation that involves an unknown function and its derivatives. They are used to describe various phenomena such as physical laws, population dynamics, and much more.

## Types of Differential Equations

Differential equations can be classified in several ways:

- **Ordinary vs. Partial**: An ordinary differential equation (ODE) involves functions of a single variable and their derivatives. A partial differential equation (PDE) involves functions of multiple variables and their partial derivatives.

- **Linear vs. Nonlinear**: A differential equation is linear if it involves the function and its derivatives linearly (no powers or products of the function), and nonlinear otherwise.

- **Order**: The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative appearing in the equation.

## Solving Differential Equations

There are many methods to solve differential equations, and the best method often depends on the type of the differential equation and the context. Some common methods include:

- **Separation of Variables**: This method is used for simple first order differential equations.

- **Integrating Factors**: This method is used for certain types of first order linear differential equations.

- **Characteristic Equation**: This method is used for second order linear differential equations with constant coefficients.

- **Laplace Transforms**: These are used for solving linear differential equations.

- **Numerical Methods**: For complex differential equations that can't be solved exactly, numerical methods (like Euler's method or the Runge-Kutta method) can be used to find approximate solutions.

## Applications

Differential equations have wide applications in various fields such as physics, engineering, economics, and biology. They are used to model natural phenomena such as the motion of planets, the spread of diseases, the oscillation of springs, and much more.
