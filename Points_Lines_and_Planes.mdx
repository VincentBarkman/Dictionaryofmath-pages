# Points, Lines, and Planes

Points, lines, and planes are the fundamental concepts in geometry. They are abstract concepts that do not have any size, i.e., length, breadth, or thickness. 

## Point

A point represents a location in space. It is usually represented by a dot and named by a capital letter. For example, we can represent a point as `A`. It has no size, only a position.

## Line

A line is a straight, one-dimensional figure extending infinitely in both directions. It is usually represented by a straight line with two arrowheads indicating that the line extends without end in both directions. `A` line can be named by any two points on the line. For example, if points `A` and `B` are on the line, we can call it Line `AB` and represent it symbolically as `ABÌ…`.

## Plane

A plane is a flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely in all directions. It can be represented visually as a four-sided figure (though its edges are not part of the plane). A plane can be named by three non-collinear points (points not on the same line) or a capital letter. For example, if points `A`, `B`, and `C` are in the plane, we can call it Plane `ABC` and represent it symbolically as `ABC`.

## Applications

Points, lines, and planes are fundamental to the study of geometry and are used in various branches of mathematics and physics, including algebra, calculus, and analytical geometry. They also form the basis for more complex geometric shapes and figures.
