# Logarithms

A logarithm is a mathematical function that determines the number needed to raise a certain base number to obtain another number.

## Definition

The logarithm to base `b` of `x` is denoted as `log_b(x)` and it is defined as the inverse operation to exponentiation, just as subtraction is the inverse of addition and division is the inverse of multiplication.

In other words, if `y = b^x` then `log_b(y) = x`.

For example, since `2^3 = 8`, the log base `2` of `8` is `3`, or `log_2(8) = 3`.

## Properties of Logarithms

1. **Product Rule**: `log_b(mn) = log_b(m) + log_b(n)`.
2. **Quotient Rule**: `log_b(m/n) = log_b(m) - log_b(n)`.
3. **Power Rule**: `log_b(m^n) = n * log_b(m)`.
4. **Change of Base Rule**: `log_b(a) = log_c(a) / log_c(b)`, for any positive base `c`.

## Common Logarithms

The most commonly used logarithms are base `10` and base `e`. Logarithms base `10` are called common logarithms and are usually written as `log(x)`. Logarithms base `e` are called natural logarithms and are usually written as `ln(x)`, where `e` is Euler's number, approximately equal to `2.71828`.

## Applications

Logarithms are used extensively in many areas of mathematics, including algebra, calculus, and complex analysis. They are also used in many practical fields such as computer science, physics, engineering, and economics. For example, they are used in calculations involving rates of change and growth, in solving exponential equations, and in data representation.
