# Vectors

A vector is a mathematical entity that has both a magnitude (or size) and a direction. Vectors are used in many areas of mathematics and physics to represent quantities such as velocity, force, and displacement.

## Basic Concepts

1. **Magnitude**: The magnitude (or length) of a vector is a non-negative number that describes the extent of the vector in space. It is typically denoted by vertical bars `(|v|)` around the vector symbol.

2. **Direction**: The direction of a vector is the orientation of the vector in space. It is typically defined in terms of angles with respect to a reference axis.

3. **Components**: A vector can be represented by its components along the axes of a coordinate system. For example, in two dimensions, a vector v can be represented as `v = (v_x, v_y)`, where `v_x` and `v_y` are the `x` and `y` components of the vector.

## Vector Operations

Several operations can be performed with vectors:

1. **Vector Addition**: Vectors can be added together to produce a new vector. The components of the resulting vector are the sums of the components of the original vectors.

2. **Scalar Multiplication**: A vector can be multiplied by a scalar (a real number) to produce a new vector. The components of the resulting vector are the components of the original vector multiplied by the scalar.

3. **Dot Product**: The dot product (or scalar product) of two vectors is a scalar whose value depends on the magnitudes of the vectors and the angle between them.

4. **Cross Product**: The cross product (or vector product) of two vectors is a vector whose direction is perpendicular to the plane containing the original vectors, and whose magnitude depends on the magnitudes of the vectors and the sine of the angle between them.

## Applications

Vectors have numerous applications in physics, engineering, computer science, and other fields. They are used to represent physical quantities such as force, velocity, and acceleration, which have both a magnitude and a direction. In computer science, they are used in graphics and machine learning, among other areas.
