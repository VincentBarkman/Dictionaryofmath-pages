# Conversion Factors

Conversion factors are used to change the units of a measured quantity without changing its value. They are based on the equivalence between different units.

## Length

- 1 meter (m) = 100 centimeters (cm)
- 1 meter = 1,000 millimeters (mm)
- 1 kilometer (km) = 1,000 meters
- 1 inch = 2.54 centimeters
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- 1 yard = 3 feet
- 1 mile = 1,760 yards = 5,280 feet

## Weight

- 1 gram (g) = 1,000 milligrams (mg)
- 1 kilogram (kg) = 1,000 grams
- 1 metric ton = 1,000 kilograms
- 1 ounce (oz) = 28.35 grams
- 1 pound (lb) = 16 ounces

## Volume

- 1 liter (L) = 1,000 milliliters (mL)
- 1 cubic meter (mÂ³) = 1,000 liters
- 1 US fluid ounce = 29.57 milliliters
- 1 US cup = 8 US fluid ounces
- 1 US pint = 2 cups
- 1 US quart = 2 pints
- 1 US gallon = 4 quarts

## Time

- 1 minute = 60 seconds
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 1 day = 24 hours
- 1 week = 7 days
- 1 year = 365 days (or 366 for a leap year)

## Temperature

The conversion between Fahrenheit and Celsius requires a formula:

- F = C * 9/5 + 32
- C = (F - 32) * 5/9

And between Celsius and Kelvin:

- K = C + 273.15

These are just a few examples. There are many other conversion factors, including those for converting between different systems of units (like metric to imperial) or within different fields (like physics or chemistry).
