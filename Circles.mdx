# Circles

A circle is a two-dimensional geometric shape that is perfectly round and consists of all points in a plane that are a fixed distance from a certain point, known as the center of the circle.

## Components of a Circle

1. **Radius**: The radius of a circle is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle.
2. **Diameter**: The diameter of a circle is the longest distance across the circle. It is twice the length of the radius.
3. **Circumference**: The circumference of a circle is the distance around the circle. It can be calculated using the formula `C = 2πr`, where r is the radius of the circle.
4. **Chord**: A chord is a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle.
5. **Secant**: A secant is a line that intersects a circle at two points.
6. **Tangent**: A tangent is a line in the plane of a circle that intersects the circle at exactly one point.

## Properties of Circles

1. **Circumference**: The circumference of a circle is proportional to its diameter. The constant of proportionality is `π`, a fundamental constant in mathematics approximately equal to `3.14159`.
2. **Area**: The area of a circle can be calculated using the formula `A = πr²`, where r is the radius of the circle.

## Applications

Circles are used extensively in various fields including geometry, trigonometry, physics, engineering, and more. They are fundamental in the study of cyclic and circular motion, waves, and in the calculation of areas and volumes of other geometric shapes.
