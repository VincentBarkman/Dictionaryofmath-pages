# Integration Techniques

Integration is a key operation in calculus. There are several techniques that can make the process of finding an integral easier.

## Basic Antiderivatives

The simplest integrals are those that come directly from basic antiderivatives. For example, the antiderivative of `x^n` is `(1/(n+1)) * x^(n+1)`, and the antiderivative of `e^x` is `e^x`.

## Substitution

Substitution, also known as the method of u-substitution, is the counterpart to the chain rule for differentiation. If the integral of a function can be simplified by substituting a part of the function with a new variable `u`, this technique can be used.

## Integration by Parts

Integration by parts is the counterpart to the product rule for differentiation. It allows us to transform the integral of a product of two functions into other (hopefully simpler) integrals.

## Partial Fractions

The method of partial fractions is used for integrating rational functions (functions that are the ratio of two polynomials). It involves expressing the rational function as the sum of simpler fractions, which can then be integrated individually.

## Trigonometric Substitution

Trigonometric substitution is used when an integral contains a square root of a quadratic expression. By substituting a trigonometric function for the variable, the integral can often be simplified.

## Trigonometric Integrals

Trigonometric integrals involve the integration of trigonometric functions. Some common patterns and formulas can help simplify these integrals.

## Integration Using Tables and Computer Algebra Systems

For more complex integrals, we may rely on tables of integrals (like those found in a calculus textbook) or computer algebra systems that can automatically compute integrals.

These techniques form the basis for integrating a wide variety of functions. By combining these techniques, it's possible to compute the integrals of complex functions efficiently.
