# Law of Sines

The Law of Sines is a relationship between the lengths of the sides of a triangle and the sines of its angles. This law is particularly useful for solving triangles that are not right triangles.

## Statement of the Law

In any triangle (not just right triangles), with sides of lengths `a, b, and c`, and opposite angles of `A, B, and C` respectively, the Law of Sines states that:
```python
sin(A) / a = sin(B) / b = sin(C) / c
```
This can also be rearranged to:
```python
a / sin(A) = b / sin(B) = c / sin(C)
```
## Usage

The Law of Sines can be used to find missing side lengths or angles in a triangle when certain other measures are known. It is especially useful in the following cases:

- When you know two angles and one side `(AAS or ASA)`.
- When you know two sides and an angle opposite one of them `(SSA)`. Note that this case can sometimes produce two possible solutions, known as the "ambiguous case."

## Proof

The Law of Sines can be derived using the properties of a right triangle. If a perpendicular line is drawn from one vertex of a triangle to the line containing the opposite side, two right triangles are formed. The sine of an angle can be defined in terms of the lengths of the sides of these right triangles, leading to the Law of Sines.

## Applications

The Law of Sines is used in various fields that involve the calculation of distances and angles, including physics, engineering, and computer graphics. It is also used in navigation and in the solution of certain types of problems in trigonometry and calculus.
