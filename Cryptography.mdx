# Cryptography

Cryptography is a method of protecting information by transforming it into an unreadable format. It is used to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data.

## Basic Concepts

Cryptography involves several fundamental concepts:

1. **Plain Text**: This is the original readable text message or data that is fed into the algorithm as input.

2. **Cipher Text**: This is the scrambled message produced as output. It depends on the plain text and the key.

3. **Encryption Key**: This is a value that is known to the sender. The sender inputs the encryption key into the encryption algorithm along with the plaintext to compute the ciphertext.

4. **Decryption Key**: This is a value that is known to the receiver. The decryption key is inputted into the decryption algorithm along with the ciphertext to compute the plaintext.

## Types of Cryptography

There are two basic types of cryptography:

1. **Symmetric Key Cryptography**: In symmetric key cryptography, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. This means the sender and the receiver must both know the key. An example of symmetric key cryptography is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

2. **Asymmetric Key Cryptography**: In asymmetric key cryptography, different keys are used for encryption and decryption. The encryption key is made public, and anyone can use it to encrypt a message. However, the decryption key is kept secret, so only the intended receiver can decrypt the message. An example of asymmetric key cryptography is the RSA algorithm.

## Cryptographic Hash Functions

A cryptographic hash function is a special class of hash function that has certain properties which make it suitable for use in cryptography. It takes an input and returns a fixed-size string of bytes, typically in the form of a hash value. The output is unique to the input; even a small change in the input will produce such a drastic change in output that the new hash value appears uncorrelated with the old hash value.

## Applications of Cryptography

Cryptography has a wide range of applications, including secure communications, passwords and authentication, digital signatures, and cryptocurrency.

Cryptography is essential for maintaining privacy and security in the digital world. Its importance continues to grow with the rise of the internet and digital communication.
