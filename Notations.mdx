# Mathematical Notations

Mathematical notation is a system of symbolic representations used for mathematical objects, operations, relations, and concepts. Here are some of the most commonly used notations:

## Basic Operations

- `+` : Addition
- `-` : Subtraction
- `*` or `×` : Multiplication
- `/` or `÷` : Division
- `^` or `**`: Exponentiation

## Equality and Inequality

- `=` : Equals
- `!=` or `≠` : Not equal to
- `<` : Less than
- `>` : Greater than
- `<=` or `≤` : Less than or equal to
- `>=` or `≥` : Greater than or equal to

## Sets

- `{}` : Set notation. Example: `{1, 2, 3}` is the set containing 1, 2, and 3.
- `∈` : Element of. Example: `1 ∈ {1, 2, 3}` means 1 is an element of the set `{1, 2, 3}`.
- `∉` : Not an element of.
- `∪` : Union of sets.
- `∩` : Intersection of sets.
- `⊆` : Subset of.
- `⊂` : Proper subset of.
- `⊇` : Superset of.
- `⊃` : Proper superset of.
- `∅` : The empty set.

## Functions

- `f(x)` : Function notation. `f` is the function, and `x` is the input to the function.

## Calculus

- `d/dx` : Derivative of a function with respect to `x`.
- `∫` : Integral symbol.
- `∆` : Delta, often used to represent a small change in a variable.
- `∂` : Partial derivative symbol.
- `∞` : Infinity.

## Summation and Product

- `Σ` : Summation symbol. `Σ_{i=1}^{n} a_i` represents the sum of `a_i` from `i=1` to `n`.
- `Π` : Product symbol. `Π_{i=1}^{n} a_i` represents the product of `a_i` from `i=1` to `n`.

## Logic

- `∧` : Logical AND.
- `∨` : Logical OR.
- `¬` : Logical NOT.
- `→` : Logical implication.
- `↔` : Logical equivalence.

## Other Symbols

- `∃` : There exists.
- `∀` : For all.
- `≈` : Approximately equal to.
- `∝` : Proportional to.

Remember that the use of these symbols can vary between different branches of mathematics and different texts.
