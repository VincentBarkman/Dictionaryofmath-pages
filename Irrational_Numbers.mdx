# Irrational Numbers

Irrational numbers are a set of numbers that cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers. This means they cannot be written in the form `p/q`, where `p` and `q` are integers and `q ≠ 0`.

## Definition

Irrational numbers are all the real numbers that are not rational. They cannot be expressed as a simple fraction, and their decimal representations are non-repeating and non-terminating.

Some of the most famous irrational numbers include `√2` (the square root of `2`), `π` (`pi`), and `e` (the base of the natural logarithm).

## Properties of Irrational Numbers

Irrational numbers have several important properties:

1. **Non-Repeating, Non-Terminating Decimals**: The decimal representation of an irrational number neither terminates nor repeats. 

2. **Closure Property (with respect to multiplication and addition)**: The sum or product of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational. However, the sum or product of two irrational numbers may be rational or irrational.

3. **Dense on the Number Line**: Between any two irrational numbers, there are infinitely many other irrational numbers.

## Relationship to Rational Numbers

Irrational numbers, together with rational numbers, form the set of real numbers. While every rational number can be written as a simple fraction or a terminating or repeating decimal, irrational numbers cannot.

## Applications

Irrational numbers are used in a variety of mathematical contexts, such as geometry (`π` is used in formulas related to circles), trigonometry, calculus (`e` is used as the base of the natural logarithm), and complex number theory. They also form the basis for the continuity of the real numbers, which is a fundamental concept in analysis and calculus.
