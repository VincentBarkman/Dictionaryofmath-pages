# Graph Theory

Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects.

## Basic Concepts

A graph is made up of a set of vertices (also called nodes or points) and a set of edges (also called links or lines). Each edge connects two vertices.

1. **Vertex**: A vertex is a fundamental unit of a graph, representing an object or entity.

2. **Edge**: An edge is a connection between two vertices, representing a relationship between the objects.

## Types of Graphs

There are different types of graphs based on their properties:

1. **Undirected graph**: A graph in which the edges have no direction, meaning that the connection between two vertices is bidirectional.

2. **Directed graph (Digraph)**: A graph in which the edges have a direction, meaning that the connection between two vertices is unidirectional.

3. **Weighted graph**: A graph in which each edge has an associated numerical value, called its weight. Weighted graphs are commonly used to represent networks with varying connection strengths or costs.

4. **Complete graph**: A graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.

5. **Bipartite graph**: A graph in which the vertex set can be partitioned into two disjoint sets such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent.

## Graph Properties and Algorithms

Graph theory provides several properties and algorithms for analyzing graphs:

1. **Degree**: The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to the vertex. In a directed graph, we distinguish between the in-degree and the out-degree of a vertex.

2. **Path**: A path is a sequence of vertices in a graph such that each vertex is connected to the next by an edge.

3. **Cycle**: A cycle is a path in which the first and the last vertices are the same, and no vertex appears more than once.

4. **Connected graph**: A graph is connected if there is a path between every pair of vertices.

5. **Graph traversal algorithms**: Breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) are common graph traversal algorithms used to visit all vertices of a graph in a systematic way.

6. **Shortest path algorithms**: Dijkstra's algorithm and the Floyd-Warshall algorithm are used to find the shortest path between vertices in a graph.

7. **Minimum spanning tree**: A minimum spanning tree is a tree that connects all the vertices in a weighted graph such that the total weight of the tree is minimized. Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm are used to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph.

Graph theory has numerous applications in computer science, engineering, biology, and other fields.
