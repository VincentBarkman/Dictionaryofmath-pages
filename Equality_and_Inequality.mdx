# Equality and Inequality

In mathematics, equality is a relationship between two quantities or, more generally, two mathematical expressions, asserting that the quantities have the same value, or that the expressions represent the same mathematical object. Inequality, on the other hand, is a relationship between two expressions that may not have the same value.

## Equality

Equality is denoted by the symbol `=`. For instance, in the equation `2 + 3 = 5`, the expression `2 + 3` is equal to `5`. This means that the sum of `2 and 3` is the same as `5`.

**Properties of Equality**:

1. **Reflexive Property**: For any quantity `a`, `a = a`.
2. **Symmetric Property**: For any quantities `a and b`, `if a = b, then b = a`.
3. **Transitive Property**: For any quantities `a, b, and c`, `if a = b and b = c, then a = c`.

## Inequality

Inequalities are relations that may be used when two quantities are not equal. There are four types of inequalities:

1. **Greater than**: Symbolized as `>`, it indicates that the first quantity is larger than the second. Example: `5 > 3`.
2. **Less than**: Symbolized as `<`, it indicates that the first quantity is smaller than the second. Example: `3 < 5`.
3. **Greater than or equal to**: Symbolized as `≥`, it indicates that the first quantity is larger than or equal to the second. Example: `5 ≥ 3`.
4. **Less than or equal to**: Symbolized as `≤`, it indicates that the first quantity is smaller than or equal to the second. Example: `3 ≤ 5`.

**Properties of Inequality**:

Inequalities, like equalities, have several properties, including transitivity and reflexivity. However, they differ in some ways, particularly in how they interact with operations like addition and multiplication.

## Applications

Equalities and inequalities are fundamental concepts in mathematics. They are used across many disciplines, including algebra, calculus, and more advanced fields. They are crucial for describing mathematical relationships, modeling real-world scenarios, and solving equations and problems.
