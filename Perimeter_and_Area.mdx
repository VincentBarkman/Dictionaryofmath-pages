# Perimeter and Area

Perimeter and area are two fundamental concepts in geometry used to measure physical attributes of shapes.

## Perimeter

The perimeter of a geometric figure is the distance around the figure. It is the sum of the lengths of all sides of the figure. For example, the perimeter of a square with side length `a` is given by `4a`, while the perimeter of a rectangle with length `l` and width `w` is given by `2l + 2w`.

## Area

The area of a geometric figure is the number of square units that can fit inside it. It is a measure of the space enclosed by the figure. For example, the area of a square with side length `a` is given by `aÂ²`, while the area of a rectangle with length `l` and width `w` is given by `lw`.

## Applications

Perimeter and area are used in a wide variety of fields, including engineering, architecture, physics, and everyday life. They are used to calculate distances around objects, space within objects, material usage for construction, land usage, and much more.
