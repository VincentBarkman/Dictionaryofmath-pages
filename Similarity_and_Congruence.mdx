# Similarity and Congruence

Similarity and congruence are two fundamental concepts in geometry used to describe the relationship between shapes.

## Similarity

Two geometric figures are similar if they have the same shape, but not necessarily the same size. This implies that the figures maintain the same proportions; the ratio of corresponding lengths in the figures are constant. Angles between corresponding lines remain the same.

For instance, all circles are similar to each other, as are all squares. For triangles, similarity is determined by the condition of similarity of triangles which states that two triangles are similar if they have two corresponding angles that are equal.

## Congruence

Two geometric figures are congruent if they have the same shape and size. This implies that the figures are identical to each other and can be superimposed onto each other. All corresponding sides and angles are equal.

For example, two triangles are congruent if their sides are of the same length and angles are of the same measure.

## Applications

Similarity and congruence are fundamental concepts in geometry and are used throughout the field, with applications extending into trigonometry, calculus, and physics. They play a crucial role in proofs and problem solving.
