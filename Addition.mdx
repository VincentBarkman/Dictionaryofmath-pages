# Addition

Addition is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic, with the others being subtraction, multiplication, and division. The process of addition involves combining two or more numbers, referred to as addends or summands, to get a larger number, referred to as the sum.

## Definition

In its simplest form, addition combines two numbers, the addends or summands, into a single number, the sum. For instance, in the equation `2 + 3 = 5`, `2 and 3` are the addends, and `5` is the sum.

Addition can also be thought of as a process that combines several quantities into a single quantity.

## Properties of Addition

Addition has several important properties:

2. **Associative Property**: The way the addends are grouped does not change the sum. If `a, b, and c` are any real numbers, then `(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)`.

3. **Identity Property**: If you add `0` to any number, the sum is that number. If a is any real number, then `a + 0 = 0 + a = a`.

4. **Inverse Property**: Every number has an additive inverse such that the sum of the number and its inverse is zero. If a is any real number, then `a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0`.

## Applications

Addition is a fundamental concept in arithmetic and algebra. It's used in a wide variety of applications, ranging from simple everyday counting and money handling to advanced science and engineering. Understanding addition is a crucial building block for more advanced mathematical concepts.
