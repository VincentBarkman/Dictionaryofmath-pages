# Systems of Linear Equations

A system of linear equations (or linear system) is a collection of two or more linear equations involving the same set of variables. For example, a system of three equations in three variables looks like:

```python
a1*x + b1*y + c1*z = d1
a2*x + b2*y + c2*z = d2
a3*x + b3*y + c3*z = d3
```

Where a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, c1, c2, c3 and d1, d2, d3 are constants.

## Solutions to a Linear System

The solution to a system of linear equations is an assignment of values to the variables such that all the equations are simultaneously satisfied. A system of equations can have:

1. **No solution**: If the lines or planes represented by the equations do not intersect, then there are no values that will satisfy all the equations at once.

2. **One solution**: If there is a single point of intersection between all the lines or planes represented by the equations, then that point's coordinates are the solution to the system.

3. **Infinite solutions**: If all the equations represent the same line or plane (or a set of coinciding lines or planes), then there are an infinite number of solutions.

## Solving a System of Linear Equations

There are several methods to solve a system of linear equations:

1. **Graphing**: Plot each equation on the same graph. The solution to the system is the point(s) where the lines or planes intersect.

2. **Substitution**: Solve one of the equations for one variable in terms of the others, and then substitute this expression into the other equations.

3. **Elimination**: Add or subtract equations to eliminate one variable, making it easier to solve for the remaining variables.

4. **Matrix Methods**: Represent the system as a matrix and use techniques from linear algebra to find the solution.

## Applications

Systems of linear equations are used in many fields, including engineering, physics, computer science, economics, and statistics. They can be used to model and solve real-world problems, such as finding the best price for goods, predicting future population trends, and analyzing circuits in electronics.
